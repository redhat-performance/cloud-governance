# Cloud Governance

## What is it?

**Cloud Governance** tool provides a lightweight and flexible framework for deploying cloud management policies focusing
on cost optimize and security.
We have implemented several pruning policies. \
When monitoring the resources, we found that most of the cost leakage is from available volumes, unused NAT gateways,
and unattached Public IPv4 addresses (Starting from February 2024, public IPv4 addresses are chargeable whether they are
used or not).

This tool support the following policies:
[policy](../../cloud_governance/policy)

[AWS Polices](../../cloud_governance/policy/aws)

* Real time Openshift Cluster cost, User cost
* [instance_idle](../../cloud_governance/policy/aws/cleanup/instance_idle.py): Monitor the idle instances based on the
  instance metrics for the last 7 days.
    * CPU Percent < 2%
    * Network < 5KiB
* [instance_run](../../cloud_governance/policy/aws/cleanup/instance_run.py): List the running ec2 instances.
* [unattached_volume](../../cloud_governance/policy/aws/cleanup/unattached_volume.py): Identify and remove the available
  EBS volumes.
* [zombie_cluster_resource](../../cloud_governance/policy/aws/zombie_cluster_resource_test.py): Identify the non-live
  cluster
  resource and delete those resources by resolving dependency. We are deleting more than 20 cluster resources.
    * Ebs, Snapshots, AMI, Load Balancer
    * VPC, Subnets, Route tables, DHCP, Internet Gateway, NatGateway, Network Interface, ElasticIp, Network ACL,
      Security Group, VPC Endpoint
    * S3
    * IAM User, IAM Role
* [ip_unattached](../../cloud_governance/policy/aws/ip_unattached.py): Identify the unattached public IPv4 addresses.
* [zombie_snapshots](../../cloud_governance/policy/aws/zombie_snapshots.py): Identify the snapshots, which are abandoned
  by
  the AMI.
* [unused_nat_gateway](../../cloud_governance/policy/aws/cleanup/unused_nat_gateway.py): Identify the unused NatGateway
  by monitoring the active connection count.
* [s3_inactive](../../cloud_governance/policy/aws/s3_inactive.py): Identify the empty s3 buckets, causing the resource
  quota issues.
* [empty_roles](../../cloud_governance/policy/aws/empty_roles.py): Identify the empty roles that do not have any
  attached policies to them.
* [ebs_in_use](../../cloud_governance/policy/aws/ebs_in_use.py): list in use volumes.
* [tag_resources](../../cloud_governance/policy/policy_operations/aws/tag_cluster): Update cluster and non cluster
  resource tags fetching from the user tags or from the mandatory tags
* [tag_non_cluster](../../cloud_governance/policy/policy_operations/aws/tag_non_cluster): tag ec2 resources (instance,
  volume, ami, snapshot) by instance name
* [tag_iam_user](../../cloud_governance/policy/policy_operations/aws/tag_user): update the user tags from the csv file
* [cost_explorer](../../cloud_governance/policy/aws/cost_explorer.py): Get data from cost explorer and upload to
  ElasticSearch

* gitleaks: scan GitHub repository git leak (security scan)
* [cost_over_usage](../../cloud_governance/policy/aws/cost_over_usage.py): send mail to aws user if over usage cost

[Azure policies](../../cloud_governance/policy/azure)

* [instance_idle](../../cloud_governance/policy/azure/cleanup/instance_idle.py): Monitor the idle instances based on the
  instance metrics.
    * CPU Percent < 2%
    * Network < 5KiB
* [unattached_volume](../../cloud_governance/policy/azure/cleanup/unattached_volume.py): Identify and remove the
  available
  disks.
* [ip_unattached](../../cloud_governance/policy/azure/cleanup/ip_unattached.py): Identify the unattached public IPv4
  addresses.
* [unused_nat_gateway](../../cloud_governance/policy/azure/cleanup/unused_nat_gateway.py): Identify the unused
  NatGateway by
  monitoring the active connection count.

[IBM policies](../../cloud_governance/policy/ibm)

* [tag_baremetal](../../cloud_governance/policy/ibm/tag_baremetal.py): Tag IBM baremetal machines
* [tag_vm](../../cloud_governance/policy/ibm/tag_vm.py): Tga IBM Virtual Machines machines

** You can write your own policy using [Cloud-Custodian](https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/quickstart/index.html)
and run it (see 'custom cloud custodian policy' in [Policy workflows](#policy-workloads)).
